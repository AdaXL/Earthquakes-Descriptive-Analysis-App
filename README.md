# Earthquakes-Descriptive-Analysis-App
Developed an application using R shiny to achieve descriptive analysis on earthquakes happened around the globe, with functions like file upload, data summary, selection, plotting and mapping


• Collected, cleaned and normalized data for analytic input

• Visualized earthquake distribution and significant level with reactive markers(differentiate by size and color) and detailed pop-ups on a world map generated using leaflet package

• Implemented sidebar selection including date, parameter range(magnitude, depth), associated events and reactiveness for customized analysis

• Summarized dataset, sorted based on different parameters, and plotted histogram and box-plot for better insight
